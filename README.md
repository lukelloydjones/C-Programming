# C++ Programming

This repository contains all my personal C++ practice and programming. It houses all the learnings
from the great text 

Pitt-Francis, Joe, and Jonathan Whiteley. Guide to scientific computing in C++. Springer, 2017.

I highly recommend it. Building a matrix class from scratch it a fantastic learning experience.
