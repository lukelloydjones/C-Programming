#include <iostream>

// Every C++ program must contain a function named main
// The main function returns an integer value that must be
// 0. A namespace is a collection of related names.

// This program uses expression and scope. An expression asks
// the implementation to compute something. The computation yields a
// result and may also have side effects. We have operators and operands
// Every operand has a type. We shall have much more to say about types,
// A type denotes a data structure and the meanings. The effects of an
// operator depends on the types of its operands

// The name std::cout is a qualified name, which uses the :: operator
// This is also known as the scope operator.

// The body of every function is a scope. Inside the scope names
// cannot be reused but outside it can.

// C++ programs are free form meaning that spaces are required only when
// they keep adjacent symbols from running together.

// Characters in doubles quotes may not span lines. Include statements
// must be on their own line.

// Types define data structures and operations on those data structures
// You can have those types that are built into the language such as
// int or those defined outside the core language such as std::ostream

// Namespaces are a mechamnism for grouping related names.

// String literals begin and end with double quotes
// Each string literal must appear on one line
// Some characters have special meaning
// \b backspace char
// \" par of the string

// \\ includes a \ in the string
//int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
//{
//
//    // insert code here...
//    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
//    return 0;
//}
